Your task is to update the IncomingMessageHandler when a message arrives. 
Check that the message has an entity_id and that the message has a session.
If a session is not found, update the lead custom fields with the values
custom_fields = [
                            {
                                "field_id": 1069656,
                                "field_name": "Custom Message",
                                "field_code": None,
                                "field_type": "textarea",
                                "values": [{ "value": messages }]
                            }
                        ]
and then run the update_lead_custom_fields function.
After successfully updating the custom fields, launch the salesbot as follows:
salesbot_result = self.kommo_service.launch_salesbot(
                                            bot_id=BotID.REPLY_CUSTOM_BOT_ID.value,
                                            entity_id=entity_id,
                                            entity_type=entity_type
                                        )
If a session is found, update the lead, but differentiate the values ​​with "Please enter your passport number" and launch the salesbot.
